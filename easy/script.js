// EASY: Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each. Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer, and by how many characters.
//  Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”

var firstName = "Rihanna"
var secondName = "Ana"
var nameSum = (firstName.length - secondName.length)

console.log(`The name ${firstName} is shorter than ${secondName} by ${nameSum} characters.`);
